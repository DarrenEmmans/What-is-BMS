<h1>Hello World</h1>

    So what the hell is BMS 
    well in this case BMS = Building managment system
    though this has been extened to BEMS = Building and energy management system
    many companys are not taking advantage of the complete set of tools available to them.
    the latest front ends available (tridium based) are way beond the available capabilitys of the original systems.
    they can perform control stratergy on the front end.

    This now brings into question the best ways to control these sites wether control is in fiel at local level 
    or at site wide though this should probly be looked at to control at a local device level on failure of the master control.
    all this should be considered at design though it appears that this is not and many systems are installed without proper 
    consideration of the implcations of what mainly appears to be cost savings at build.

    I have worked on many site that are commissioned and finised that then either need to be redesigned or live with non ideal conditions
    there appears to be a race to the bottom where the cheapest system is installed.
    
    many site are installed with multiple manufatures equipment Bacnet is used yet this tends to tie the end user to many diffrent manufactures as opposed to 1.
    as each bacnet device though they communicate via a common protocol require the manufactures software to configure the device.
